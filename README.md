# SWE573TermProject
SWE573 Software Development Term Project (Sping, 2018)

The project, which is going to be a Twitter API, is a part of the course SWE573: Software Development Practice, instructed by Dr. Suzan Üsküdarlı at Boğaziçi University in Spring 2018. The repositories of the project will be written in Python and be posted on a weekly basis.
The API will be able to determine the prime time intervals in a day, week, month or any custom time interval during when the followers of the brands in Twitter use their accounts more often. Following the API results, brands will tweet more on those hours, ensuring that their tweets will reach more and more people.

Name of the project is IBEST which stands for Increase Brand Engagement by Scheduling Tweets. Further details about the project can be found in [wiki](https://github.com/korayozgurbuz/SWE573TermProject/wiki) page.
