# SWE573TermProject
SWE573 Software Development Term Project (Sping, 2018)

The project, which presumably is going to be a Twitter API, will be a part of the course SWE573: Software Development Practice, instructed by Professor Suzan Üsküdarlı at Boğaziçi University in Spring 2018. The repositories of the project will be written in Python and be posted on a weekly basis.
The API will be able to determine the prime time intervals in a day, when the followers of brands in Twitter use their accouts more often. Following the API results, brands will tweet more on those hours, ensuring that their tweets will reach more and more people.
